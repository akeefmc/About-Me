      <h3>What I Wish to Bring With Me</h3>
      <p>I have spent most of my career analyzing data which, in turn, has been used to improve the machine learning processes for vehicles at Tesla or applications such as Apple maps.</p>
      <p>In my last three years working in those positions, I have learned to collaborate with different people and departments to achieve my goals. I hope to keep up the spirit of collaboration as I learn to code at Thinkful as well.</p>
